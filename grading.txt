A7 mirrorArms                  - 1/3   one arm short.   I think I remember telling you to move on - if you completed this successfully and 
just went back to print something out for Mr. Harpe, let Mr. Harpe know and you'll get full credit.

A9 edgeDetection               - 1/3  The algorithm isn't quite correct, in the sense that rather than looking at a single pixel and comparing
                                      it to its neighbor to the right AND its neighbor below, you do it in two steps, and CHANGE the pixel
                                      immediately - so the second pass is working off of modified data.   Since you have a white swan and 
                                      a dark background, if the first pass changes the color of the water to 'white' because its neighbor
                                      to the right isn't an edge, and your white swan is below, you'll miss that edge.

 +5 for good effort.   There are a couple things that should've been cleaned up.  36/50
